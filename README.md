## Introduction
Welcome to Nahara's Canvas Lite, an open source Android drawing app for, well, sketching mostly, but
that doesn't stop you from drawing entire artwork from start to finish.

## Why choose Nahara's Canvas Lite?
- **Infinite canvas**: Never run out of area to sketch on! (other than your device's storage space)
- **Adaptive UI**: Whether you are using Note10 or MovinkPad, the user interface is designed to
  adapts to phone and tablet form factors.
- ~~**Flipbook**: Make animations with virtual flipbook.~~
- **Free**: No strings attached. Really.

## Why NOT choose Nahara's Canvas Lite?
While it seems unusual to see the anti-reason for using an app under description, Nahara's Canvas
Lite have some limitations that are introduced on purpose:

- **No advanced layer system**: Your favorite layer grouping or selection mask is not coming to this
  lite version, sorry.
- **No advanced brush system**: To keep the app smooth on wide range of Android devices (we are 
  talking about Helio G99 tablets here), the brush system is kept to be simple but also packed with
  some essential features, such as stylus dynamics or stamp-based brush engine.
- **No comics management**: Although Nahara's Canvas Lite have flipbook for animations, there is no
  system for managing comic pages.

In other words, Nahara's Canvas Lite is meant to be used together with other apps, rather than
trying to be "one size fits all". In fact, some features in Canvas Lite are designed around this
idea, like "Open in other app" for example.

## App distribution
